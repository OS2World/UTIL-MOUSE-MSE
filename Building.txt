Building MSE                               			02 Apr 2003
=============

MSE is designed to make mousing about the old desktop a bit easier.  It
allows you to assign various commands to your mouse buttons with or without
keyboard modifiers.  It also provides optional clipboard management and
extension, swapfile monitor, desktop clock, virtual desktops, screen capture,
file dialog enhancement, titlebar enhancement and some other mouse-related
options.  Sorry, kitchen sink not included. MSE requires OS/2 Warp (3.x+) or
better.


Tools
=====

The following tools have been used to build binary distributions:

  IBM VisualAge C++ V3 with FP8
  IBM Developers Toolkit v4.5

Older versions of the Toolkit may work.  There are no known special setup requirements.


Building
========

Unzip the source code distribution to a work directory.

Build the release version with:

  NMAKE

Build the debug version with:

  NMAKE DEBUG=1

The build outputs are:

  MSE.EXE
  MSEHOOK.DLL
  MSE.INF


About MSE
=========

MSE was originally written by:

  <hectorplasmic@worldnet.att.net>

He has kindly allowed me to take over maintenance and support of MSE and to
release the program under the GNU GPL license.  I'm sure he would appreciate
a Thank You note for his generosity.

I monitor the comp.os.os2.programmer.misc newsgroup and others in the
comp.os.os2.* hierarchy.
