                MSE -- An OS/2 PM Mouse and System Enhancer
                       Free Software from Mark Kimes

ABOUT MSE:
=========

MSE is designed to make mousing about the old desktop a bit easier.  It
allows you to assign various commands to your mouse buttons with or
without keyboard modifiers.  It also provides optional clipboard
management and extension, swapfile monitor, desktop clock, virtual
desktops, screen capture, file dialog enhancement, titlebar enhancement
and some other mouse-related options.  Sorry, kitchen sink not included.
MSE requires OS/2 Warp (3.x+) or better.


INSTALLING:
==========

Run the provided INSTALL.CMD program to do all the installation work for
you.  Or VIEW the MSE.INF file and install from there.  You can even
read this file from there.  Try it -- type VIEW MSE.INF at a command
line, or open MSE.INF's WPS object.


UNINSTALLING:
============

The UNINSTAL.CMD can remove MSE from your system automagically for you,
if you decide to do so later.


There's more info in the MSE.INF file in the archive (type "VIEW MSE").
Please DO browse through it!  The program has convenient links to
sections of this file, accessible by clicking the various [?] buttons.
