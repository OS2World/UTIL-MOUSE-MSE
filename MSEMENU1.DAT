;
; MSEMENU1.DAT -- a sample for MSE
;
; You can place the name of a program to run or the objectID of a WPS
; object in this file, and it'll be accessible in a menu in MSE.  The
; commands "Menu #1" through "Menu #7" activate them.  This menu will
; be activated by the "Menu #1" command (hence the "1" in the filename).
;
; Note this is more of an example file than an attempt to do something
; actually useful...
;
;
; Hints:
; =====
;
; MSE will allow you to create a menu definition file if you try to
; access one that doesn't exist.  If you select a command from a menu
; while holding down the Ctrl key, MSE will allow you to edit the
; menu definition file instead of executing the command.  The menu will
; automatically be reloaded when you're done editing.  You can edit
; the file normally with some other editor, but then you'll need to
; use the "Reload menus" option to cause all menus to be reloaded the
; next time you try to pop them up -- no biggie.
;
;
; Rules:
; =====
; If the name of the program contains a space _and_ you wish to give
; an argument to the program after the name, you must enclose the
; program name in quotes (like on a command line).  For example:
; "MY TERRIBLY COOL.EXE" file.txt
;
; If you give a fully qualified path to the program, that path will be
; used as the initial starting directory when the program is run;
; otherwise, the default directory (MSE's) will be used.
;
; To specify a WPS object, it must have an objectID.  You can create
; named objects using REXX (see below).  ObjectIDs have the form: <OBJECTNAME>
; Examples of pre-named objects (look in \OS2\INI.RC for more):
;  The system clock:         <WP_CLOCK>
;  The Drives object:        <WP_DRIVES>
;  The font palette:         <WP_FNTPAL>
;  The system setup folder:  <WP_CONFIG>
; Exception:  Folders and data files can be opened just by specifying
; their fully qualified path name (i.e. C:\OS2\BITMAP).
;
; To specify a different menu to be invoked by a menu item,
; use & as the first character of the command, and include
; the number of the menu.  For example:
;  &My MSE menu #1
;  &My other MSE menu (7)
; MSE keys on the first number between 1 and 7 in the text to figure
; out which menu to invoke.
;
; Lines cannot exceed 1000 bytes in length.
;
; One entry per line.
;
; Lines beginning with a semi-colon (like this one) are comments, and
; are ignored.  They have to be read from disk, so don't go overboard
; (like this file :-).
;
; You can have up to seven of these menu files, named MSEMENU#.DAT
; where # is 1-7.
